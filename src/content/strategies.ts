Philosophy
The most important thing to keep in mind when doing cold outreach:

The goal is to set up a call, not sell your services!

No one is going to invest $5k, $10k, or $50k for a service without talking to you on a call first.

Strategies
Three main strategies.

1. Giving before asking for something
Some customers insist that they always give before asking. If you do web design, you should give them a small mockup or improvement for their website. If you run a cybersecurity agency, run a small security audit for them. If you do branding, record yourself going over some points on their website. You get the point. Offer something. And ask for nothing. Just strike up a conversation.

When they reply, tell them that you're available whenever they may need some help. That's it.

As you can imagine, this is personalization on steroids. But, of course, time consuming.

Many successful CyberLeads customers use this technique.

2. Asking for something straight away
Others take a more classical approach. They reach out with a personalized email, explaining what they do and ask to schedule a call. The key word here is personalization, otherwise it's plain pitching your product/service.

3. Just starting a conversation
Others only start a conversation with a simple question. Like, in my case, I could start by asking you if you do cold outreach. Then if you reply, send you some leads as a gift and tell you that I would love to help you out to close some deals.

Getting the first reply is the most important thing with cold outreach. Even if it's just a "Yes".

Personalization
There is no way getting around this. But then again, you don't have to send hundreds of emails if you do it correctly. Everyone I speak to that has success, personalizes messages. You could go to crazy lengths, or not. It's a trade-off. You could hire a VA to do them manually for you, or use AI tools.

Alternatively, the information provided in the lists is enough for some basic personalization.

Message structure
Your message should be short, simple and personalized. No links. No formatting. No fancy words.

The point is to sound like a human, not a robot. Or a salesperson. You have to sound like someone that is trying to help them out, not trying to pitch his/her service.

Your message should look something like this.

Disclaimer
The email template below is not the exact email some customer uses. But the philosophy is the same.
Part 0: Subject line
Short and simple, like "Quick question" or "Some ideas for CompanyName". Or any variation of the above. No need to stress this too much.

Part 1: Personalized first line
Hey firstName, I just found out that you raised money for companyName! Must be exciting.

Open up with a personalized message. Keep in mind that it will be shown in the preview text of the email as well, so it will boost open rates.

Show them that you know them. This is just an example, it could be anything and written in any way.

However, in our case, we have their first name and can also congratulate them for raising money, since it happened recently and it's a big milestone.

But you can get more creative if you like, in order to stick out. It's up to you.

Part 2: Case study
Here you explain why you're reaching out, by telling them what you've done for other companies. No one cares about us. They care about what we can do for them.

For example, if I were to pitch CyberLeads to you, my message would be something like this:


"My name is Alex and I just helped HailBytes, a marketing agency similar to yours close a $40k/year deal inside three months by providing them with high quality leads."


Note the "similar to yours". It's personalization, again.

Part 3: Why you're reaching out
In the next sentence we explain why we're reaching out. Depends on our approach.

Examples:

"Big fan of your work. Would love to share a couple ideas with you on what types of leads I could provide you with to achieve similar results."

"I was having a look at your website and I couldn't help but notice a few things that could be improved. I have attached a screenshot/video at the bottom."

Part 4: CTA
Here you can either ask directly for call or alternatively lower the commitment to boost replies.

The trade off is that you will have more replies to handle and not all of them will result in a call.

Example of a high ask CTA:
"Have some time sometime this week for a call?"

Example of a low ask CTA:
"Want me to create a small PDF with some ideas for you to view?"

Example of a no ask CTA:
"Curious if this would be interesting."

Little pro tip, you can also start with a low ask or no ask CTA and propose a quick call "to walk them through it" once they respond.

Part 5: Signature
Last but not least, our signature. Again, minimum links. No images, etc. We want our email to be as text based as possible with as little links as possible.
